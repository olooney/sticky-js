This is a simple-but-cute example of some draggable, stretchable, editable
sticky notes on a web page.  It works in all browsers I've tested although is a
little jittery in IE.  It uses jQuery and jQuery-UI for most of the effects,
adding features to bring the current note to the top and to automatically
stretch the note if the user types too much text, and gluing it all together in
less than 100 lines of code and a dash of of CSS.

The code is mine and is placed in the public domain. The corkboard background
and handwritten font are not but you can find attribution links at the bottom
of the page.
