This is a simple-but-cute example of some draggable, stretchable, editable sticky notes on a web page.
It uses jQuery and jQuery-UI for most of the effects, adding features to bring the current note to the 
top and to automatically stretch the note if the user types too much text, and gluing it all together in 
just 50 lines of code and another 35 lines of CSS.

The code is mine and is placed in the public domain. The corkboard background and handwritten font are
not but you can find attribution links at the bottom of the page.
